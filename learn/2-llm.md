# Understanding Large Language Models: How Machines Learn, Think, and Speak

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, or Gemini have transformed the way we interact with computers. They can write essays, translate languages, summarize books, and even reason about abstract concepts.
But **how do they actually work**? What are *tokens*, *embeddings*, *parameters*, and *dimensions*?
Let’s explore these ideas step by step — without code, but with clarity.

## 1. From Words to Tokens

The first step in any LLM’s process is turning text into pieces it can understand.
These pieces are called **tokens**.

A token isn’t always a full word. It can be:

* a whole word (`"cat"`)
* a part of a word (`"un"`, `"believ"`, `"able"`)
* or even punctuation (`"!"`, `"?"`, `","`)

So a sentence like:

```
ChatGPT is powerful
```

might become:

```
[Chat, G, PT, is, powerful]
```

This step is called **tokenization**. It allows the model to work with a limited set of building blocks instead of trying to memorize every possible word in every language.

## 2. From Tokens to Numbers: The Embedding Matrix

Computers can’t reason about words directly — they only understand numbers.
So every token must be converted into a list of numbers that represents its meaning.
This list of numbers is called an **embedding**.

Imagine a giant spreadsheet (called the **embedding matrix**) with one row per token and hundreds or thousands of columns. Each row is a unique numeric fingerprint for that token.

Example (simplified):

| Token | Embedding (3D example) |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| cat   | [0.8, 0.2, 0.1]        |
| dog   | [0.7, 0.25, 0.1]       |
| car   | [0.1, 0.9, 0.8]        |

When the model reads “cat,” it looks up its row — just like looking up a word’s meaning in a dictionary — and uses that vector as input.

This process of **lookup** doesn’t yet “understand” language; it’s just translating text into math.

## 3. The Geometry of Meaning: Vectors in Space

Now that each word is a vector, we can imagine all words living inside a huge **space of meanings**, sometimes called the *embedding space*.

* Words that are **semantically similar** (like “dog” and “cat”) end up close together.
* Words that are unrelated (“cat” and “car”) are far apart.

You can picture it like a 3D map:

```
dog ●
cat ●
car            ●
```

Of course, real models don’t use just three dimensions — they use hundreds or thousands. Each dimension captures some hidden feature of meaning (like “living thing”, “color”, “action”, “positive/negative”, etc.).
But no human explicitly defines these. The model discovers them by itself during training.

## 4. Training: How the Model Learns

LLMs are trained by showing them **billions of sentences** and asking them to predict the next word (or token).

For example:

```
Input: "The cat sat on the"
Expected output: "mat"
```

If the model predicts “floor,” it’s not punished harshly — but it gets a small correction: all its internal numbers (called **parameters**) are adjusted slightly to make “mat” more likely next time.

After repeating this process on trillions of examples, the model learns deep patterns of grammar, style, and reasoning — not by memorizing, but by statistically shaping the landscape of its parameters.

## 5. What Are Parameters?

Parameters are the adjustable numbers that define the model’s behavior — the knobs it turns to fit the data.
A small model might have millions of parameters; GPT-4 is believed to have **trillions**.

You can think of parameters as the “wiring” between neurons in a brain: the more there are, the more subtle and complex the reasoning can be.
But more parameters also mean more computational cost and training time.

## 6. The Role of Dimensions

Each embedding is a vector with a fixed number of **dimensions** — for example, 512, 768, or 4096.
The number of dimensions is a design choice made by the engineers who build the model.

More dimensions mean:

* greater capacity to represent fine-grained meaning,
* but higher computational cost.

Fewer dimensions make the model faster but less expressive — like describing a painting using only two colors.

During training, the model learns **how to use** these dimensions.
It discovers which combinations of coordinates represent useful distinctions (e.g. “verb vs noun,” “animate vs inanimate”) — though these aren’t human-interpretable.
The structure *emerges naturally* as the model optimizes its predictions.

## 7. The Transformer: The Brain of the Model

Modern LLMs are built on an architecture called the **Transformer**.
Its key innovation is *attention* — the ability for the model to focus on the most relevant words in a sentence.

Example:

```
The cat sat on the mat.
```

When predicting “mat,” the model pays attention mainly to “cat” and “sat,” and less to “the.”
This mechanism allows it to handle long-range dependencies and complex relationships, like “The book that you gave me yesterday was fascinating.”

## 8. Why LLM Output Is Not Deterministic

One of the most surprising facts about LLMs is that they **don’t always give the same answer** to the same question.
That’s because they’re not programmed to produce *one correct output* — they’re designed to produce *plausible continuations* based on probabilities.

For each token, the model assigns probabilities:

```
"The cat sat on the" →
mat: 0.72
floor: 0.15
chair: 0.07
table: 0.03
```

The model can then:

* pick the most likely token every time (deterministic, but boring), or
* **sample randomly** according to these probabilities (non-deterministic, but more natural).

This random sampling is controlled by a setting called **temperature**:

* Temperature = 0 → always picks the most likely word (reliable, robotic)
* Temperature = 1 → more variation (creative, human-like)
* Temperature >1 → chaotic (useful for brainstorming, not for facts)

So when you ask an LLM the same question twice, it may “roll the dice” differently each time, giving unique phrasings or even different arguments — just like a human rephrasing their thoughts.

## 9. Putting It All Together

Here’s the full chain of what happens when you send text to a language model:

1. **Tokenization:** Split text into tokens.
2. **Embedding Lookup:** Convert tokens to numerical vectors.
3. **Transformer Processing:** Use attention layers to analyze relationships between tokens.
4. **Prediction:** Output the probability distribution for the next token.
5. **Sampling:** Choose the next token (deterministically or probabilistically).
6. **Repeat:** Continue until a stop signal or token limit is reached.

Every sentence you see is the product of this loop running hundreds or thousands of times in fractions of a second.

## 10. Why This Matters

Understanding these concepts — tokens, embeddings, dimensions, parameters, and non-determinism — changes how we think about AI.

* **It’s not magic.** It’s statistics at massive scale.
* **It’s not conscious.** It’s pattern recognition on steroids.
* **It’s not random.** It’s probabilistic — creative by design, not by accident.

The next time you talk to a model, you’re not “asking a brain.”
You’re collaborating with a vast probabilistic system that’s mapping meaning in a space of numbers — a space we built, but that now builds with us.
